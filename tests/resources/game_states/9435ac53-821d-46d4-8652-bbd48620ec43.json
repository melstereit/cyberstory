A datachip vendor's stall, shuttered tight, leans against one wall. Three figures emerge from the shadows, their faces obscured by glowing cybernetic implants and cheap, black market respirators. They move with a practiced menace, their hands hovering near the concealed weapons beneath their tattered coats. One of them spits a glob of something foul onto the wet pavement. They don't look friendly.",
