The air smells of synth-ramen and desperation. The alley walls are covered in layers of graffiti and decaying posters. A rusted fire escape zigzags up the side of a towering building, promising a precarious escape route. A nearby dumpster overflows with discarded tech and biological waste. The rhythmic pulse of the city's underbelly vibrates through the grimy pavement.",
