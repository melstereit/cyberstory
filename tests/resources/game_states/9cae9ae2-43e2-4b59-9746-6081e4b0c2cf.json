Gutters overflow with a viscous, luminescent sludge. Above, holographic advertisements flicker, casting distorted shadows that dance across the grimy walls. The air crackles with the hum of illicit power lines and the distant throb of a rave. You're here to meet Pollux's contact, 'Whisper,' but something feels off. A sudden metallic *clink* echoes from the darkness ahead, followed by the unmistakable whir of charging energy weapons.",
