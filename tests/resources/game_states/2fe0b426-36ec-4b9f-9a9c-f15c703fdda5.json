    "description": "You find yourself standing at the mouth of Neon Alley, a narrow passage choked with flickering holographic advertisements and the ever-present scent of synthetic ramen and decay. Rain slicks the grimy plasteel walkways, reflecting the garish lights in a dizzying array. The air is thick with tension. Two figures stand silhouetted against a pulsing neon sign further down the alley. One is a hulking brute with chrome implants glinting under his greasy mohawk; the other is a wiry individual fidgeting nervously. Both are clearly waiting for someone, and their posture screams hostility. You recognize the brute's jacket - a 'Crow Eater' gang patch. Could this be connected to Bam Bam Crow's death?",
