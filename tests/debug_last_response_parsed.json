  "response": "Your Cyber Eyes activate, enhancing your perception. Thermal imaging highlights the heat signatures of Rico and Shiv, revealing their positions even through the dim light. The camera function zooms in, providing a closer look at Rico's neural interface jack and Shiv's metallic knuckles. The HUD overlays tactical information: Rico's bio-signs are stable, suggesting he's calm and collected, while Shiv's are elevated, indicating agitation. You notice Rico is tapping away on a wrist-mounted device. The flickering neon sign above is causing some visual distortion, but your systems compensate.",
