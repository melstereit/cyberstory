- Spieleraktion: "i use cyber eyes"

## Aufgabe
Analysiere die Spieleraktion und bestimme, was passieren sollte. Entscheide, ob ein Würfelwurf erforderlich ist oder ob die Aktion automatisch gelingt/misslingt.

## Output-Format
Deine Antwort sollte ein JSON-Objekt mit folgenden Feldern sein:
```json
{
  "requires_check": true/false,
  "check_context": {
    "action": "Beschreibung der Aktion",
    "relevant_trademark": "Name des relevanten Trademarks oder null",
    "relevant_edges": ["Edge1", "Edge2"],
    "gear_tags": ["Tag1", "Tag2"],
    "advantageous_tags": ["Tag1", "Tag2"],
    "disadvantageous_tags": ["Tag1", "Tag2"],
    "opposition_scale": 0
  },
  "response": "Antwort für den Spieler, wenn kein Würfelwurf erforderlich ist",
  "state_update": {
    "game_state": {
      "history_event": "Ereignis für die Historie",
      "scene_updates": {},
      "world_state_updates": {},
      "quest_updates": {}
    },
    "character": {
      "add_condition": "Bedingung hinzufügen",
      "remove_condition": "Bedingung entfernen",
      "add_item": {},
      "remove_item": "Item-Name"
    }
  }
}
```

Wenn `requires_check` true ist, wird ein Würfelwurf durchgeführt, und das Feld `check_context` wird verwendet, um den Würfelpool zu berechnen.
Wenn `requires_check` false ist, wird die `response` direkt angezeigt, und `state_update` wird verwendet, um den Spielzustand zu aktualisieren.
