## Aufgabe
Basierend auf dem Würfelergebnis, generiere passende Konsequenzen für die Aktion des Spielers. 

Das Ergebnis ist:
- Erfolgsgrad: partial (success, partial, failure oder botch)
- Wert: 4
- Boons: 0

## Output-Format
Deine Antwort sollte ein JSON-Objekt mit folgenden Feldern sein:
```json
{
  "description": "Ausführliche Beschreibung der Konsequenzen",
  "game_state_updates": {
    "history_event": "Ereignis für die Historie",
    "scene_updates": {

    "tick_drive": 0,
    "cross_out_drive": 0
  },
  "scene_completed": false
}
```

Sei kreativ, beschreibe die Konsequenzen lebhaft und berücksichtige das Würfelergebnis sowie den Kontext der Szene.

- Bei einem vollen Erfolg (success) sollte der Spieler sein Ziel erreichen, möglicherweise mit zusätzlichen Vorteilen für Boons.
- Bei einem Teilerfolg (partial) sollte der Spieler sein Ziel mit Einschränkungen oder Kosten erreichen.
- Bei einem Misserfolg (failure) sollte der Spieler sein Ziel nicht erreichen und negative Konsequenzen erleiden.
- Bei einem kritischen Misserfolg (botch) sollten die Konsequenzen besonders schwerwiegend sein.
